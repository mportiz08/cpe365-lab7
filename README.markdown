# Lab 7

### A Java Swing Interface for the INN Dataset

## Info

**Team Members:**

* Sam Becker
* Marcus Ortiz
* Alan Yang

## Usage
 
If you have `ant` installed, the easiest way to run the program from the command line is:

    ant run

(If for some reason, the `dist/` folder doesn't exist, use `ant` without arguments to compile the program)

don't have `ant` installed? try this instead

    java -jar dist/lab7.jar

If all else fails, we used netbeans to create the app, so you can just open the root folder for the project with netbeans and run it there (shouldn't be necessary).
